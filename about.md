At present I am a Software Engineer at Cisco working on the Webex Contact Center.
My core focus is on the development, maintenance and ongoing support of the 
media stack which handles calls. I work along side many other talented engineers 
across the globe to deliver an effective scalable cloud contact center as a service.

My background is in Computer Science having graduated from the University of
Surrey in 2010 with a first class honours degree in Computer Science. Shortly
thereafter I began my development journey working as a Solution Development
Engineer at Perceptive Software (later acquired by Lexmark).

For my entire professional career I have worked in software development teams
and have experience developing in a wide range of environments and have 
accumulated experience with a wide range of tools, languages, frameworks 
concepts and methodology. Most of my professional experience has been with
the development of web applications and microservices.

I am a lover of the outdoors and enjoy a good adventure. I also like to stay in
shape and I train with the local triathlon club, of which I am also a committee 
member where I (of course) take care of their website and booking system.
