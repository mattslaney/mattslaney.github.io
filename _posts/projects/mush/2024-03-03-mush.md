# Brief
Mush is a command line tool I am developing to make backing up data an
effortless task. Mush will take multiple source directories and mush them 
together into a single destination directory whilst allowing files and 
folders to be ignored with an ignore file and also taking care to
deduplicate data.

# The Need
I started developing mush because I was looking for a suitable project to learn
the rust programming language with and I also had a lot of old hard disk drives
which I wanted to sort through and free up some space. Over the years I have 
taken many backups of my data and as a result I have many backups of the same 
data across multiple hard drives and in many cases even backups on the same 
hard drive itself. What was important to me at the time was just that I had
backed up the data.

Now I would like to declutter a bit and have a slightly more organised system.
To do this I hope to consolidate years and years of data onto a couple of
larger backup drives and perhaps repurpose or recycle the old drives I no longer
need.
