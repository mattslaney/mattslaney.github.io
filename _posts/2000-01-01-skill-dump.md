This is just a skill dump, merely a list of existing skills I am familiar with
and have used in a personal or professional capacity over the years. The purpose
of this post is just to provide the Skillspace page with some initial tag data.

I have designed the skillspace tag cloud in a way that eventually the more I
make posts about a particular skill the larger the tag will be in the cloud.
Also, tags will be coloured based on which tags have had the most recent content
to form a sort of heat map of the skills I am currently working with the most.
Tags colored red have had posts in the last 14 days, yellow in the last 28,
green in the last 56 and then blue for tags that I have not posted about 
recently.

Obviously, it's a huge dump of buzzwords right now but hopefully in time, with
consistency and regular posting, it should start to reflect my area of 
expertise and current focus.
