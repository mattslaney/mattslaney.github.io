> working on reinforcing or expanding my knowledge in.

Below is a tag cloud for posts on my github site, I make posts for each topic 
I am familiar with. Each tag is colour coded depending on my most recent
contributions. Red for most recent, then yellow, then green, then blue for tags
I have not used recently. The size of the tag relates to the number of posts I
have made about this tag.
